# 🛠 Gitops

This repository utilizes Flux. Flux is a tool for keeping Kubernetes clusters in sync with sources of configuration (like Git repositories), and automating updates to configuration when there is new code to deploy. Please have a look at the [docs](https://fluxcd.io/docs/).

Also have a look at this great chart:

## 📁 Repository Structure

```text
cluster/
├── base/flux-system/   # Flux controllers, GitRepository, HelmRepositories, encrypted secrets
├── crds/               # Custom Resource Definitions
├── core/               # Infrastructure components
└── apps/               # Applications, organized by namespace
```

Flux reconciles in order: `base` → `crds` → `core` → `apps`.

## 🔐 Secrets

Secrets are encrypted at rest using [SOPS](https://github.com/mozilla/sops) + [age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age). Files matching `*.sops.yaml` are automatically decrypted by Flux during reconciliation. The age key is expected at `~/.config/sops/age/keys.txt`.
